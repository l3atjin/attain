## Notes
Here are some bonus things that I thought of putting but haven't had a chance yet. 
* grid layout has fixed 2 columns -> adjust based on screensize for responsiveness
* the cart state should probably be a global or context, not local to the component
* use useCallBack to improve the fetch performance
* use useDebounce to improve the search performance
* how should add to cart work if you wanted to decrease the quantity?
